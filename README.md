A11Y notes:
I made a number of adjustments to the colors, including hover and link colors for acceptable contrast ratio. Since I have a number of links in my header/nav, I set up a skip link to allow the user to skip to the main content. I set up hidden text for the iframe map (contact page) and social media icons in the footers to notify that the links will open into a new tabs (although I'm not quite sure if the way I did it on the google map is right since the link is built into the iframe map). I adjusted my radio buttons fieldset so they all appear on their own line to give them a larger clickable area.
